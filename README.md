# Palindrome Checker (Java)

This is a simple Java program that checks whether a given string or number is a palindrome.  
A palindrome reads the same forward and backward (example: madam, 121).

## Features
- Checks strings and numbers
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Easy beginner-friendly logic

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Console-based application

## How It Works
The program takes input from the user, reverses it, and compares it with the original value to determine whether it is a palindrome.

## Example
Input: madam  
Output: Palindrome
